# Computer Vision Deepfakes (First Order Model Method): Face Synthesis With GANs and Autoencoders
<p align="justify">The term deepfakes originated in 2017 when a Reddit user named “deepfakes” shared the first ever of this media online. These videos involved celebrities’ faces swapped onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos. Since then academic research and interest in deepfakes (a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake") has grown quickly. Deepfakes leverage powerful machine learning to manipulate a source image and generate a video using a driving media to generate visual content with a high potential to deceive. Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their uses in celebrity pornographic videos, fake news, hoaxes, and financial fraud. This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use. This project uses Aliaksandr Siarohin First Order Model Method to generate and create deepfakes of various politicians and famous sports figures. The project explains deepfakes and what they are. How they can be created and the technology behind them including generative adversarial networks, neural networks and autoencoders. The paper ends with a section about the ethics of these media and the importance of recognizing that they exist so that the public is less likely to be deceived.</p>
